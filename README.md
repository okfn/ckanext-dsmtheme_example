# ckanext-dsmtheme_example

An example extension showing how to customize the CKAN frontend

## How it works

The repository contains a step-by-step process of building an extension. Each
step is contained in a single commit, and flagged with a git tag (`step1`,
`step2`, ...)

You can move between steps using the ``git checkout`` command. For example to
start on the first step::

    git checkout step1

To move to the next step::

    git checkout step2

And so on. Once on a particular step, you can see the description of the whole
step and the files changed using the `git show` command.

You can also browse the steps on GitHub:
